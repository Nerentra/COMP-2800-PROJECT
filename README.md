# QuietQuest

QuietQuest is a web app designed to help introverts build their social confidence in a quiet, low-pressure way. By providing daily, gentle challenges, QuietQuest empowers users to grow at their own pace and regain confidence on their own terms.

## Problem

Many people, especially introverts, find it difficult to build their social confidence, particularly in a post-COVID-19 world. The growing tech culture driven by social media often discourages real-world interaction, and there are few tools available to support personal growth in a private and reflective manner.

## Solution

QuietQuest offers a supportive platform for introverts by delivering daily challenges such as:

- Reflecting on a personal strength.
- Starting a small conversation with someone.
- Setting a positive intention for the day.

The app aims to foster growth through private reflection and encourages users to regain their confidence in a quiet, non-judgmental space.

### Features

- **Daily Challenges**: Gentle tasks designed to help users grow at their own pace.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your growth over time.
- **Privacy-Focused**: A safe space for self-improvement without external pressure.
